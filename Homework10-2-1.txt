Dear Friends,

Trump’s trade war with China is causing a variety of concerns,
ranging from its impact on US farmers to its potential to raise consumer prices in both China and the US. 
(wages, )
The answers to your first and second question on in the same.

~That’s the only way I can explain a day why both stock fall.~

On September 17th, President Trump announced his decision to impose a 10% tariff 
on the Section 301 list of $200 billion in imports from China.  
On January 1, 2019, the 10% tariff rose to 25%.
China accused the U.S. of launching a trade war and said China would respond in kind with similar tariffs for US imports,
and each of them continues to argue about tariffs. 
The tariffs threaten to hurt business confidence and delay investment.
Citing the trade war, both countries cut its growth forecasts for 2019. 

Because of this, tax expenses out of Guandong have risen significantly cutting into our profit.

The industry as a whole performed well in 2018, and expectations remain broadly positive for this year.
The momentum of 2018 should keep pushing progress forward.
Despite recent fluctuations, the outlook remains positive for modest to moderate increases in most categories
at least through the first part of 2019.
Our projection for this year remain positive, howerver, Due to this recent trade war complications, 
our actual growth may be less than our estimated growth.

If there has any questions, please feel free to contact me.
