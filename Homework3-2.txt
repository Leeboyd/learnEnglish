Cultural Distance Between U.S. and Taiwan

Language
In Taiwan, Mandarin Chinese is the only national language. Although there are seven distinct aboriginal languages, most Taiwanese and aboriginese speak both Mandarin and local Taiwanese languages.

Unlike Taiwan, the United States has no official language, English is the most commonly spoken language within the United States. Following English, the most spoken languages in the United States are Spanish, Chinese and French etc.

Dressing/Clothes
Speaking of dressing/Clothes, Taiwanese dress the same as Americans do. When dressing for business, ladies wear dress, skirt, or suit. Men wear ties and leather shoes. 
A differences is you should take your shoes off while entering someone else's home in Asia, and will be provied slippers. Also, wearing flip-flops in public maybe inappropriate depending on the situation.

Rules/ Social aspect vs. legality  
The United States is rule-based. That means that everthing is based on set rules. Failure to comply with these rules comes with consequences. Taiwanese tend to influence people more than trying to have rules and those types of things. That means the influences can come from parents, teacher, and other peers. Which means Taiwanese tends to limit things, and we should have a more solid system based off of these limitation not just by feeling, experience or under sb's watch.
