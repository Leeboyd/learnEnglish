Innovation in your industry
2018 is the year where we are seeing some of the most exciting technologies turning commercially viable.
For instance, blockchain has become a hot tech topic since 2017. Many tech companies introduced their own blockchain platforms in 2017 and they are establishing partnerships/partnering up with banks, retail distributors, and government to put blockchain to use. 

What does this all mean for the software industry? The battle for enterprise-level blockchain application is just beginning to heat up, which means the demand for developers is going to explode.

The downsides for us developers is most of the software development trends in 2018 require more than just basic programming knowledge. Those challenges make us feel threatened — we don’t have enough time, energy or money to meet these hassles. To stay up to date I think is the only way.
