Hi,
Thank you for the comprehensive email about the 2019 conference.
I have some specific questions:
Q: I am a foreign national. Do I need a visa to enter Macau?

Q: I need a formal letter of invitation to participate in the conference. 
Who should I contact?

Q: My company/organization is interested in sponsoring the conference.  
Who should I contact for sponsorship opertunities?

Thank you so much!
