My name is LeeBoy. I was born in Kaohsiung. I am a first child with a family of four.
As the first child, I had to take care of myself and my younger brother and helped doing household chaos like washing dishes and doing laundry.
I think this was the reason how I learned the values of being a responsible person.

I spent most of my time in Tainan as s student and finished my bachelorâ€™s degree there. My major was management information systems (MIS), it about how to put technology to work. I think one thing what I learned from school is waging the interest of businesses and organizations. Deal with practical problems and find solutions are really excites me.

For the past two years I have worked in software developing. Working in technical role, my job function is not only developing and debugging computer programs but also learing how to managing projects.

In my spare time, I work out and hang out with my friends and family. To keep up with new technology, I participate in open source community as well as read tech blogs.
