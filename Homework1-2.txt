I didn’t even want to be in Shenzhen in the first place. I went there because I wanted to support my dad. He had to stay during national day of People’s Republic of China about 10 days for work.

Before the trip, I had heard how polluted the skies were or the filthy roads that were jammed by honking cars. I promised myself to visit China just for this time. I knew I was heavily influenced by sterotype, which in turn affected my perception of China as a whole.

I can’t describe the whole country based on my sterotype, right? I was glad that I had given it another chance. I landed in Hong Kong and took subway to Shenzhen. As soon as I got there, I'd found that the street wasn’t as dirty or uncivilized as I once thought it was. It actually felt like a mix between Zhongli and New Taipei city: bustling streets, developed public transportation and luxurious malls and hotels. People were not that differet, Taiwan and China, even though I love Taiwan more.

So the lesson to me is this: Don’t make judgements based on limited experiences. I should have to be open and be willing to try things more.
